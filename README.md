## Usage

1. Click the extension icon in your Chrome toolbar
2. Click "Scan for Duplicates"

   - ‚úì Which bookmarks/folders will be **kept** (newest ones)
   - ‚úó Which bookmarks/folders will be **deleted** (older duplicates)

## How It Works

### Bookmark Matching
Bookmarks are matched by their **exact full URL**, including:
- Protocol (http/https)
- Domain
- Path
- Query parameters
- Fragment identifiers

**Example:**
- `https://example.com/page1` ‚â† `https://example.com/page2` (kept - different pages)
- `https://example.com/page1` = `https://example.com/page1` (deduplicated - exact match)

### Folder Matching
Folders are matched by their **exact name**:
- Duplicate folders with the same name are identified
- The newest folder is kept
- Older folders and all their contents are marked for deletion

### Duplicate Resolution
When duplicates are found:
- Items are sorted by creation date (`dateAdded`)
- The **newest** item is kept
- All older duplicates are marked for deletion
